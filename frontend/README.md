Yes, the Next.js App Router has a specific and powerful folder structure. Here is a standard, production-grade layout.

## Folder Breakdown
This structure organizes your project for scalability and clarity.

your-project/
├── app/
│   ├── (api)/
│   │   └── ... (API routes)
│   ├── (main)/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   └── posts/
│   │       ├── [postId]/
│   │       │   └── page.tsx
│   │       └── page.tsx

│   └── common/
├── lib/

└── ... (config files like next.config.mjs)
app/ 📂
This is the core of your application.

Routing: Folders inside app create URL routes. A file named page.tsx inside a folder makes it a publicly accessible page. For example, app/posts/page.tsx becomes the /posts URL.

Dynamic Routes: Folders with square brackets, like [postId], create dynamic routes. app/posts/[postId]/page.tsx will handle URLs like /posts/1, /posts/2, etc.

Route Groups: Folders in parentheses, like (main), are for organization. They do not affect the URL. This is useful for grouping related sections of your site.

layout.tsx: A special file that defines a shared UI layout for a route and its children. The root layout in app/layout.tsx is where you define your <html> and <body> tags.

## components/ 🧩
This is for your React components, just like in your previous setup.

ui/: Small, reusable building blocks like Button.tsx or Input.tsx.

common/: Larger, application-specific components like Navbar.tsx or PostCard.tsx.

## lib/ 📚
This folder is for utility functions, helper code, and library configurations.

Example: utils.ts for helper functions or axios.ts to configure an Axios instance.

## public/ 🖼️
This is for all your static assets that need to be served directly, like images, fonts, or favicon.ico. Files here are accessible from the root of your domain.

Example: An image at public/logo.png can be accessed in your code as /logo.png.

## services/ & stores/ 📡
These folders have the same purpose as before:

services/: To keep your API fetching logic (e.g., postService.ts).

stores/: To keep your Zustand state management stores (e.g., authStore.ts).



whenever we have a relationship with foreign key we need to create a relationship with the object.
check out comments-user, posts-user etc.
