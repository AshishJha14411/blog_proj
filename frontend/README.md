app/
This is the main Python package where all the application's source code resides.

core/
Purpose: Holds the core logic and configuration of the application. This is a good place for files that manage application settings (e.g., loading from the .env file) or singleton clients.

models/
Purpose: Contains all SQLAlchemy ORM models. Each file in this directory typically represents a database table, defining its schema in Python code.

routes/
Purpose: Defines the API endpoints (or routes). Each file typically groups related endpoints (e.g., users.py, posts.py) using APIRouter. This keeps the main application file clean.

schemas/
Purpose: Contains all Pydantic schemas. These schemas are used for data validation of incoming request bodies and for formatting response data, ensuring a consistent API contract.

services/
Purpose: Contains the business logic of the application. Routes should call functions in the service layer to perform actions. This abstracts the core logic away from the web layer, making it reusable and easier to test.

utils/
Purpose: A directory for miscellaneous helper functions and utility code that can be used across the application (e.g., a function to format dates or process strings).

dependencies.py
Purpose: A dedicated file for creating and managing FastAPI's dependencies, such as get_db for database sessions or functions to get the current authenticated user.

main.py
Purpose: The main entry point for the FastAPI application. This file initializes the FastAPI app, includes the routers from the routes/ directory, and sets up middleware.

alembic/
Purpose: Stores the database migration scripts generated by Alembic. Whenever you make a change to your SQLAlchemy models, Alembic creates a new version script here to apply that change to the database.

venv/
Purpose: The Python virtual environment directory. It contains all the project-specific dependencies isolated from the global Python installation. This folder is ignored by Git.

File Breakdown
.env
Purpose: Stores environment variables and application secrets like database credentials, API keys, and secret keys. This file is never committed to version control.

.gitignore
Purpose: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This includes the venv/ directory, .env file, and Python cache files.

alembic.ini
Purpose: The main configuration file for Alembic. It tells Alembic how to connect to your database and where to find the migration scripts.

requirements.txt
Purpose: A list of all the Python packages required to run the project. This file is used to install all dependencies with a single command (pip install -r requirements.txt).























This structure emphasizes a clear separation of concerns, making your application easier to navigate, maintain, and scale.

## Folder Breakdown
Here's the purpose of each directory:

assets/ 🖼️
Purpose: To store static assets like images (JPEGs, SVGs), custom fonts, and other media files.

components/ 🧩
Purpose: For all your reusable React components. This is the core of your UI.

**ui/**: Contains small, generic, application-agnostic UI elements. Think of these as your building blocks (e.g., Button.tsx, Input.tsx, Card.tsx).

**common/**: Contains more complex components that are specific to your application but are used in multiple places (e.g., Navbar.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, PostCard.tsx). These are often composed of smaller components from the ui/ directory.

hooks/ 🎣
Purpose: To store your custom React hooks. Any logic starting with use that you want to share between components goes here (e.g., useAuth.ts, useApi.ts).

lib/ 📚 (or config/)
Purpose: For setting up and configuring third-party libraries. A great example is creating a pre-configured axios instance for your API calls.

pages/ 📄
Purpose: Contains components that represent entire pages or views in your application, which are tied to specific routes (e.g., HomePage.tsx, LoginPage.tsx, PostDetailPage.tsx).

services/ 📡 (or api/)
Purpose: To abstract all your API communication logic. This is where you'll write functions that fetch data from your backend (e.g., postService.ts would have functions like getAllPosts or createPost).

styles/ 🎨
Purpose: For global CSS styles. While you'll use Tailwind for most things, this is the place for base styles, CSS variables, or styles for third-party libraries that you need to override. Your index.css file fits well here.

utils/ 🔧
Purpose: A place for miscellaneous helper functions that are not specific to React and don't render any JSX (e.g., functions for formatting dates, validating input, or manipulating data).
